## Collections

}
```

**Fields:**

- `createdAt` (timestamp) — when the driver profile was created.
- `lastLoginAt` (timestamp) — last time the driver logged in.

### 2. `deliveries/{deliveryId}`

Stores individual delivery jobs assigned to drivers.

**Example document:**

  "orderId": "ORDER_1001",
  "customerName": "Jane Doe",
  "address": "123 Main St, Springfield",
  "lat": 37.7749,
  "lng": -122.4194,

This collection is the source for:

- Driver deliveries list in the app.

### 3. `device_tokens/{driverId}`

Stores the latest FCM device token for each driver.

**Example document:**

```json
{
  "token": "fcm_device_token_here",

### 4. `driverOtps/{driverId}`

Stores temporary OTP codes for phone verification.

**Example document:**

```json
{
  "code": "123456",
  "phone": "+1 555 123 4567",

This collection is written by the app during OTP request and read during OTP verification.
